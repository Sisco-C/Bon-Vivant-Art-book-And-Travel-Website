      <p style="font-weight: bolder; color: black; font-style: italic;"> Purple Hibiscus, Chimamanda Ngozi ~ As Written by Laurette M.</p>
      <img src="https://books.google.co.ke/books/content?id=icXZ3--EFOsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE708DMKccvPztKE9ez9dlkdLNvrn4yUdx6WV3GRxSZfyCFSAgY08mGqY4qpvPKNwBUG1RjE2p_BKmcnqGaX9zy9IUs1dswE09opX5gMgQjYkxhPFQGzm3GvUvhTcXX-tpTP4CXX9" width="200px;" height="auto;">

  I have read Purple Hibiscus three times, in four days. I read it the first time, then the second time to fully grasp it and then the third time and each time, I feel Kambili’s longing. She is 15 years old, lives with her mother, a father who is affluent and her brother Jaja. You get to grow with Kambili from being a shy girl to a full extrovert that can handle herself. She is the voice of the story. Kambili’s father, Eugene, is tyrannical and a deep follower of religion. He disregards anything traditional, terming it as heathen. This causes him to outcast his father. Everything is so oppressive, the religion, the home and the country.
His sister, Aunty Ifeoma, has a different parenting style than that of Eugene. Eugene parents through fear (acts of violence) and so much authority that is so suffocating, while on the other hand Ifeoma gives her children the freedom of expression. The difference in parenting is seen in how different this kids behave. Ifeoma’s kids are able to voice out their opinions while Eugene’s kids stutter all the time and the can’t laugh openly.
Eugene and Ifeoma have different views on their father’s spirituality. While Eugene thinks his father is a heathen, Ifeoma thinks he is a traditionalist. Ifeoma allows her kids to spend time with him, while Eugene doesn’t allow his kids to spend time with him apart from 15 minutes during Christmas holiday.
Kambili doesn’t rebel her father, instead she worships him so much and wants to gain his approval.Kambili’s salvation is found in Nsukka. Against better judgement, Eugene allows his kids to go to Nsukka at Ifeoma’s place. There they experience a life outside what they’re used to. Here there is freedom and there is expression. At first, the look like misfits. But Jaja soon adapts to this life. Kambili fears her father so much, thus fights against adapting.
The story centers on family, religion, domestic violence and the state of politics in Nigeria. A good read. I’d fully recommend.

      <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;"> Dead At Daybreak,  Deon Meyers ~ As Written by Felix M.</p>
      <img src="https://www.littlebrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/9780316027892.jpg?fit=438%2C675" width="200px;" height="auto;">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>	Zatopek Van Heerden (a former cop in South Africa) is hired by a lawyer (Hope Beneke) to locate the will of Jacobus Strut, a furniture dealer who was murdered, in order for his wife (Wilna Van As) to get his estate. Zet, as he is referred to throughout the novel, has 7 days to find the will. His search for it leads him to unearthing the history of Strus, who had no records prior to 1986. As the story unfolds, we are given a look at Zet’s personal life, from his struggles in relationships to his hits and misses in career. The story also unearths the evils in South Africa together with the underhand dealings of secret intelligence and security organizations. The story ends with Zet finding the will and the truth about Strut.
	The novel was a hit. The story had a good flow and was captivating. Several twists in the plot made the book extremely interesting. Likewise, the development of Zet as a character was thorough and well done. However, the ending of the book was rushed. The villain was not mentioned anywhere until the final stages of the book. His back story was also not well crafted. Female characters in the book were not given lives of their own, their stories all revolved around their interactions with Zet. All in all, the novel was very thrilling, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
